# Pente (for scrubs)
A java implementation of the board game Pente. In particular, this is intended to be a test platform for competing pente AI. Still a work in progress.

To compile this project and test a game between two players playing random moves, simply type ant

To build your own player, implement the Player interface and add your player to src/pente/Players
